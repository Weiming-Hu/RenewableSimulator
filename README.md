# Evergreen: A Renewable Energy Simulator

## Introduction

`evergreen` is implemented with [the System Advisory Model (SAM)](https://sam.nrel.gov/) and [pvlib](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) from Sandia National Lab. SAM is a performance and financial model designed to facilitate decision making for people involved in the renewable energy industry.

This simulator focuses on solar photovoltaic power simulation. It uses ensemble weather predictions from [the Analog Ensemble package](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/).
